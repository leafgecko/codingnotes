### OOD Object Oriented Programming
 - Encapsulation
 - Data hiding
 - Inheritance
 - Polymorphism
    - Overloading

 Abstraction, Object, Class

#### Standard C++ consists of: 
Core language, Sandard Library (functions), Standard Template Library (STL) (methods)

#### Collection of Objects: invoking each other's methods
- Object    - has **states** and **behaviours**. An instance of a class
- Class     - **template** describing behaviour/state that object of its **type support**
- Methods   - a **behaviour**. class has many methods; where logics are *written*, data is *manupliated*, actions *executed*
- Instance Variables - **unique** to each object. Object's **state** is created by **values assigned** to instance vars

```
#include <iostream>   //header
using namespace std;  //for compiler

int main() {
   cout << "Hello World"; // prints
   //cin >>
   return 0;
}
```
Running Code (ald in directory)
    g++ <file_name.cpp>   //compiles Code
    ./a.out               //auto saves exe file as a.out
